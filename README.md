# The WFE Thing (frontend)

Because GitHub will shout at me if I don't have one.

The frontend html/js/css/etc for [The WFE Thing](http://wfe.johz.me).  This assumes that all the files will be placed at the root, with the backend server serving all routes addressed to `/api`.  If you don't want this to be the case, you'll need to change the hardcoded URLs everywhere.  I didn't really design this to be reused, rather to ensure that anyone can see it, understand it, and fix my bugs.  If I do suddenly disappear from NS, feel free to rehost this as and how you like it.  Hell, if you think you can do a better job than me (you probably can) do that now.
